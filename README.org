* YouTube-Block
Blocks or allows youtube videos based on tags
** versions
*** 0.0.1
    initial release
*** 0.0.3
    - encoding did no good and failed sometimes
    - regex was case-sensitive
*** 0.0.4
    - was not youtube-specific
** plan
   1) set intersection for tags
   2) allow user to set tags
      1) via preferences
	 - how to do with array?
      2) best via panel
   3) block message
   4) test youtube-update check for tags
      - maybe ask so if non-working
